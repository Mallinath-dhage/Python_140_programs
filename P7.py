# WAP to input user’s first name & print its length.
first_name = input("Enter your first name: ")
length = len(first_name)
print(f"The length of your first name is: {length}")    

# Here we are taking the user's first name as input and then calculating its length using the len() function.
# Finally, we are printing the length using an f-string to format the output.
# f-strings are a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces {}.
